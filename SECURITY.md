## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.
Please disclose it at [security advisory](https://github.com/lit/lit/security/advisories/new).

We will be following the 90-day deadline to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure.
